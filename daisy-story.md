4. The people that she lives with she seems to think aren't real people.
5. She seems to be curious about the sun for some reason
6. She seems to think that the sun had burned out, but Ron seems to disagree with that theory
7. Daisy seems to be afraid of going through puberty, because it results in "darkness and blood and people wanting to penetrate her darkness."
8. Her father said that the sun is going to go nova
