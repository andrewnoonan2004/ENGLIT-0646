# Mr. Burns: A Post Electric Play
## Based on the Simpsons cartoon sitcom
1. Commissioned to write a play about what would happen to a pop culture narrative pushed past the fall of civilization
## The Simpson's
1. Animated
2. A "Meta" show
3. A Sitcom
4. Its position as a comedy helps to make it more memorable
5. The characters are archetypal, and the characters are static.
6. Modern sitcom's are serialized, but not so with the Simpson's
7. It is "comfort food"
## Takes place in the very near future
1. The play starts in a forest with the characters trying to recall a Simpson's episode
2. They seem to need to correct others about the episode if they are slightly off.
3. Washburn drops us into this group with little context
4. The Simpson's is a form of escape.
5. We don't really even know that this is apocalyptic until they start talking about it.
6. We are somewhere outside of New York City
7. At some point the nuclear power plants start to go down.
8. Washburn leaves it vague to give herself some leeway and also to demonstrate that the characters aren't fully aware of what happened.
9. They go through Gibson's stuff, and they begin to ask him if he is aware of certain names that they have written down.
10. All groups have this sort of ready to go list of people, and apparently the lists have gone down from 10 to 8.
