## Moon of the crusted Snow notes

1. So far they have lost power
2. We are on the precipice of something bad, sort of the calm before the storm
3. We think that it takes place in relatively modern times
4. Almost like covid where people were rushing to the stores to buy essentials.

### The divide between certain people on the reservation
1. Some people, like Evan and the elder want to maintain the old traditions
2. Some people are more contemporary, and don't care us much about maintaining the old traditions
3. Some people have a stronger sense of community and willingness to sacrifice, for example with the power, while some weaker
4. Some people have become dependent upon the luxuries of modern life

### The foreshadowing of the dreams
1. The dreams of some of the native people are becoming very worrisome, and perhaps are a sense of foreshadowing
2. With very little communication with the outside world, perhaps people are expecting the worst.
