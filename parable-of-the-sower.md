# Octavia Butler(1947-2006)
1. Started writing sci-fi in the 1970's
2. Parable of the Sower
## Lecture Notes
1. We are getting it from the point of a 15 year old black girl
2. Most of the time apocalypses are from the point of view of an old person
3. This is another example of the generation gap in apocalypse
4. She hasn't know what life was like before the apocalypse, so she isn't looking back to the way that life used to be, and Lauren doesn't believe that we will ever be able to return to how life was.
## Hyper-empathy
1. What is it like for someone with hyper-empathy growing up in a painful environment
2. She feels the pain of others
3. She doesn't like hurting people, but when she feels like she has to she kind of takes it too far
## Fire as an existential threat
1. We can see how the fire destroys their house and kills people
2. Fire spreads, just like the Chaos in this post-apocalyptic America
3. Water is expensive, which makes it worst
4. Public services are now privatized
5. You can't rely on the police to protect you.
## Her religion, Earthseed
1. She has accumulated all of these quotes from over the years
## She explicitly doesn't follow her father's religion
1. She believes in a different idea of God.
## Lauren wonders how much protect their wall truly provides, and how long it will last.
1. Change is the only constant in the universe.
