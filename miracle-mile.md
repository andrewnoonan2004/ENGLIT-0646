## How the Apocalypse unfolds
1. A guy gets a random phone call saying that nuclear destruction is upon them.

3. A professional looking woman seems to confirm what Harry was saying
4. Fred believes that Harry is joking, pulls a gun on him
5. The drag queen seems to be the only person who doesn't believe Harry
## Most people aren't aware of what is happening

3. Landa takes him seriously, and she has connections to a lot of powerful people, and she *verifies* that many powerful people are heading to the southern hemisphere
4. The guys respect landa, so when she starts to get worried they start to get worried
## To what extent is it going to be a hoax
1. We are kept on edge to whether or not it is legitimate, and it takes awhile for it to be verified.
2. Once it starts to get seriously, with stealing the cop car and "killing" the cops, it starts to become more believable.
3. In the process of trying to save Julie, many people die.
4. It would normally seem like a heroic and romantic gesture, but eventually becomes pretty horrific.
## He wants to save her but doesn't want her to know
1. They have only known each other for a day, and he doesn't want to ruin that last day until it is necessary.
## He *Thinks* he is doing the right thing, and his motivations are good
